            <h2>Agents, Roles and Abilities</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most important aspects to know in Valorant is which characters you learn and specilize in. One of the keys to win a game is to have a balanced team composition. A balanced team is a team that has a variation of different characters. Each agent has their own roles and specialties. A good example of a reliable team comp is Reyna, Sage, Brimstone, Killjoy and Breach. With this team, you have a strong defense and attack side. This team has smokes for cover, healing, resurrection, flashes and abilities to watch flanks and hold off the enemy's attack.
            </p>

            <p> These are the roles currently in the game: Duelist, Initator, Controller, and Sentinel. A good team has an agent in each of these roles. Some agents and their abilities are more useful on some maps than others.</p>

            <p>There have been additional agents that have been added to this list. </p>

            <h2>Agent Voicelines</h2>
            <p>The agents' voicelines are important to pay attention to when playing Valorant, especially in competitive. Riot has specially made voicelines to help people with no mics able to communicate to your team. However the voicelines you need to learn and recognize will help you prepare for the incoming attack. This short audio recording will play each agent's ult voicelines so you can be prepared.You will first hear your teammates ult line and you will hear the enemy's ult line second.</p>

            <h2>Agent Biographies</h2>
            
                <h2>Duelists</h2>
                <h3>Reyna</h3>
                <p>Forged in the heart of Mexico, Reyna dominates single combat, popping off with each kill she scores. Her capability is only limited by her raw skill, making her highly dependent on performance.</p>
                
                
                <h3>Phoenix</h3>
                <p>Hailing from the U.K., Phoenix's star power shines through in his fighting style, igniting the battlefield with flash and flare. Whether he's got backup or not, he'll rush into a fight on his own terms.</p>
                
                <h3>Jett</h3>
                <p>Representing her home country of South Korea, Jett's agile and evasive fighting style lets her take risks no one else can. She runs circles around every skirmish, cutting enemies before they even know what hit them.</p>
                
                <h3>Raze</h3>
                <p>Raze explodes out of Brazil with her big personality and big guns. With her blunt-force-trauma playstyle, she excels at flushing entrenched enemies and clearing tight spaces with a generous dose of “boom.”</p>
                
                <h3>Yuro</h3>
                <p>Japanese native, Yoru, rips holes straight through reality to infiltrate enemy lines unseen. Using deception and aggression in equal measure, he gets the drop on each target before they know where to look.</p>
                

                <h2>Sentinels</h2>
                <h3>Sage</h3>
                <p>The stronghold of China, Sage creates safety for herself and her team wherever she goes. Able to revive fallen friends and stave off aggressive pushes, she provides a calm center to a hellish fight.</p>
                
                <h3>Killjoy</h3>
                <p>Forged in the heart of Mexico, Reyna dominates single combat, popping off with each kill she scores. Her capability is only limited by her raw skill, making her highly dependent on performance.</p>
                
                <h3>Cypher</h3>
                <p>The Moroccan information broker, Cypher is a one-man surveillance network who keeps tabs on the enemy's every move. No secret is safe. No maneuver goes unseen. Cypher is always watching.</p>
                

                <h2>Controllers</h2>
                <h3>Viper</h3>
                <p>The American chemist, Viper deploys an array of poisonous chemical devices to control the battlefield and cripple the enemy's vision. If the toxins don't kill her prey, her mind games surely will.</p>


                <h3>Brimstone</h3>
                <p>Joining from the USA, Brimstone's orbital arsenal ensures his squad always has the advantage. His ability to deliver utility precisely and from a distance make him an unmatched boots-on-the-ground commander.</p>

                <h3>Omen</h3>
                <p>A phantom of a memory, Omen hunts in the shadows. He renders enemies blind, teleports across the field, then lets paranoia take hold as his foe scrambles to learn where he might strike next.</p>

                <h3>Astra</h3>
                <p>Ghanaian Agent Astra harnesses the energies of the cosmos to reshape battlefields to her whim. With full command of her astral form and a talent for deep strategic foresight, she's always eons ahead of her enemy's next move.</p>

                <h3>Sova</h3>
                <p>Born from the eternal winter of Russia's tundra, Sova tracks, finds, and eliminates enemies with ruthless efficiency and precision. His custom bow and incredible scouting abilities ensure that even if you run, you cannot hide.</p>

                <h3>Breach</h3>
                <p>Breach, the bionic Swede, fires powerful, targeted kinetic blasts to aggressively clear a path through enemy ground. The damage and disruption he inflicts ensures no fight is ever fair.</p>

                <h3>Skye</h3>
                <p>Hailing from Australia, Skye and her band of beasts trail-blaze the way through hostile territory. With her creations hampering the enemy, and her power to heal others, the team is strongest and safest by Skye’s side.</p>
